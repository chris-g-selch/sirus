Capture plastic from ditches, creeks, drains and tributaries saving Wildlife and turn millions of metric tons of garbage into fuel; thus eliminating Land  Fields that produce Methane Gas which greatly contributes to Extreme Climate Change. Create reusable fuel and products that can have their final life cycle repaving roads that last far longer than regular asphalt roads forging a circular economy.  Use unused neighborhood spaces to create Community Gardens which will eliminate Food Deserts by forcing produce prices down.
