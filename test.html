Earl Hilliard Jr has been getting back to me for 7 months now to set up a meeting to discuss this. Our tax dollars are going towards antiquated processes and being wasted ! I dont want much of a commission nor contract but i do not work for free ! Its all based on what i save the City. I have submitted RFP's and got no reply ! I would appreciate ur help or advice ? Ive already talked to Dept heads and im not giving up my ideas w/o compensation ! I want my tax dollars to go to Dept Heads that live in and are "Stakeholders" in my City! The Census tract shows Huntsville will surpass Bham like they did Montgomery in 2-3 yrs because w/ the exception of UAB Bham is crippled by dependency on mostly retail. </p>
